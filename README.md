### Key Components

- **`scripts/`**: This is the main directory where all bash scripts are organized by category. For example, scripts related to OS-specific tasks, networking, backups, security, etc.

- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files and templates that can be used by scripts. These are also organized by system, network, and application contexts.

- **`docs/`**: Contains documentation specific to different types of scripts. It might include usage examples, environment setup instructions, or detailed explanations of complex scripts.

- **`tests/`**: Includes unit and integration tests for the scripts, ensuring they work as expected. Test data can be stored in the `testdata/` subdirectory.

- **`lib/`**: A directory for shared libraries and functions that can be sourced by scripts. This promotes code reuse and consistency across the scripts.

- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the repository, instructions for using the scripts, contributing guidelines, and any other important information.

- **`.github/`**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, such as running ShellCheck to lint the scripts, and issue templates to streamline contributions and bug reporting.
- **`projects/` Directory**: A new directory under `scripts/` named `projects/` is created to house all project-specific scripts.
  
- **Project Subdirectories**: Each project has its own subdirectory (`project1/`, `project2/`, etc.) within the `projects/` directory. This keeps scripts organized by the project, preventing them from cluttering the general-purpose script directories.

- **Project-Specific Scripts**: Scripts related to specific projects are stored within their respective project subdirectories, making it easy to manage and identify scripts that belong to particular projects.

### Benefits for project-isolation

- **Isolation of Project-Specific Logic**: Keeping project-specific scripts in their dedicated subdirectories prevents them from interfering with general-purpose scripts and allows for easy navigation.

- **Scalability**: As more projects are added, their scripts can be organized in separate subdirectories, making the monorepo scalable.

- **Reusability**: Common utilities and libraries in the `lib/` directory can be reused across both general and project-specific scripts, promoting code reuse.

- **Consistency**: This structure maintains a consistent organization pattern, making it easier for team members to locate and manage scripts.


### Benefits of a monorepo structure

1. **Modularity**: Each script has a clear purpose and is organized by function, making it easier for sys admins to find and use what they need.
  
2. **Reusability**: The `lib/` directory encourages the reuse of common functions, reducing redundancy.

3. **Scalability**: The structure can easily scale with more scripts, categories, and tests as the repository grows.

4. **Maintainability**: With organized documentation and testing, maintaining the scripts becomes simpler and more reliable.

5. **Cross-Platform Consideration**: By separating OS-specific scripts, you can ensure that scripts behave as expected across different environments.

6. To accommodate project-specific scripts within the proposed monorepo structure, you can introduce a dedicated directory for each project under the `scripts/` directory. This approach maintains the modularity and organization while keeping project-specific scripts clearly separated from general-purpose scripts.

## Reviewdog ShellCheck Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to run ShellCheck on shell scripts within the repository. It ensures that your scripts adhere to best practices and are compatible across different operating systems. 
Below is a breakdown of how the workflow is configured by default, also see: https://github.com/reviewdog/action-shellcheck
The workflow invokes the action which does the following:
```yaml
name: reviewdog-shellcheck
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  shellcheck:
    name: runner / shellcheck
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      # Run the job on multiple operating systems to ensure cross-platform compatibility
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: shellcheck-github-pr-check
        uses: ./
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
      - name: shellcheck-github-check
        uses: ./
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
          reporter: github-check
          level: warning
          filter_mode: file
          pattern: '*.sh'
          path: '.'
          exclude: './testdata/*'
          shellcheck_flags: '--external-sources --severity=style'
      - name: shellcheck-github-pr-review
        uses: ./
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
          reporter: github-pr-review
          pattern: '*.sh'
          path: '.'
          exclude: './testdata/*'
      - name: shellcheck-shebang-check
        uses: ./
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
          filter_mode: nofilter
          pattern: |
            *.sh
          path: |
            .
            ./testdata
          exclude: |
            ./testdata/test.sh
            */.git/*
          check_all_files_with_shebangs: true
```

### Workflow Breakdown

- **Name and Trigger**: The workflow is triggered on every pull request (`on: [pull_request]`) to ensure that new changes to the codebase are checked immediately.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The job runs on multiple operating systems (`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`) using a matrix strategy. This ensures that the shell scripts work consistently across different environments.

- **Checkout Code**: The workflow begins by checking out the code from the repository using the `actions/checkout@v4` action.

- **ShellCheck GitHub PR Check**: 
  - The first check (`shellcheck-github-pr-check`) runs the ShellCheck linter and provides feedback directly in the GitHub pull request interface.
  
- **ShellCheck GitHub Check**:
  - The next step (`shellcheck-github-check`) uses the `github-check` reporter to post the results as GitHub Checks with a warning level. 
  - It filters files with the `.sh` extension, excluding those in `./testdata/`, and uses specific ShellCheck flags to set the severity level to `style`.

- **ShellCheck GitHub PR Review**:
  - This step (`shellcheck-github-pr-review`) adds inline comments directly on the PR using the `github-pr-review` reporter.
  - It checks files with the `.sh` extension, excluding those in `./testdata/`.

- **Shebang Check**:
  - The final step (`shellcheck-shebang-check`) verifies that all shell scripts with a shebang (`#!`) line are checked, ensuring that no script is missed.
  - It processes all files with `.sh` extensions, including those in `./testdata`, but excludes specific paths like `./testdata/test.sh` and any files in `.git` directories.

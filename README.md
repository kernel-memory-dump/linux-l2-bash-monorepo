### Key Components

- **`scripts/`**: This is the main directory where all bash scripts are organized by category. For example, scripts related to OS-specific tasks, networking, backups, security, etc.

- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files and templates that can be used by scripts. These are also organized by system, network, and application contexts.

- **`docs/`**: Contains documentation specific to different types of scripts. It might include usage examples, environment setup instructions, or detailed explanations of complex scripts.

- **`tests/`**: Includes unit and integration tests for the scripts, ensuring they work as expected. Test data can be stored in the `testdata/` subdirectory.

- **`lib/`**: A directory for shared libraries and functions that can be sourced by scripts. This promotes code reuse and consistency across the scripts.

- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the repository, instructions for using the scripts, contributing guidelines, and any other important information.

- **`.github/`**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, such as running ShellCheck to lint the scripts, and issue templates to streamline contributions and bug reporting.
- **`projects/` Directory**: A new directory under `scripts/` named `projects/` is created to house all project-specific scripts.
  
- **Project Subdirectories**: Each project has its own subdirectory (`project1/`, `project2/`, etc.) within the `projects/` directory. This keeps scripts organized by the project, preventing them from cluttering the general-purpose script directories.

- **Project-Specific Scripts**: Scripts related to specific projects are stored within their respective project subdirectories, making it easy to manage and identify scripts that belong to particular projects.

### Benefits for project-isolation

- **Isolation of Project-Specific Logic**: Keeping project-specific scripts in their dedicated subdirectories prevents them from interfering with general-purpose scripts and allows for easy navigation.

- **Scalability**: As more projects are added, their scripts can be organized in separate subdirectories, making the monorepo scalable.

- **Reusability**: Common utilities and libraries in the `lib/` directory can be reused across both general and project-specific scripts, promoting code reuse.

- **Consistency**: This structure maintains a consistent organization pattern, making it easier for team members to locate and manage scripts.


### Benefits of a monorepo structure

1. **Modularity**: Each script has a clear purpose and is organized by function, making it easier for sys admins to find and use what they need.
  
2. **Reusability**: The `lib/` directory encourages the reuse of common functions, reducing redundancy.

3. **Scalability**: The structure can easily scale with more scripts, categories, and tests as the repository grows.

4. **Maintainability**: With organized documentation and testing, maintaining the scripts becomes simpler and more reliable.

5. **Cross-Platform Consideration**: By separating OS-specific scripts, you can ensure that scripts behave as expected across different environments.

6. To accommodate project-specific scripts within the proposed monorepo structure, you can introduce a dedicated directory for each project under the `scripts/` directory. This approach maintains the modularity and organization while keeping project-specific scripts clearly separated from general-purpose scripts.
